What is Schemaverse?
The Schemaverse is a space-based strategy game implemented entirely within a PostgreSQL database. Compete against other players using raw SQL commands to command your fleet. Or, if your PL/pgSQL-foo is strong, wield it to write AI and have your fleet command itself!

Why? 
People play the Schemaverse for variety of reasons. Some of those include: 
- Teaching and learning SQL (along with other database interaction)
- Database Security research
- Playing with AI
- Developing graph and map based UIs
- Looking like you are working while actually playing a sweet space battle game


I created this game to learn more about security in postgres. This means that this game is probably extremely insecure. 
DON'T RUN THIS ON SOMETHING IMPORTANT.  


Requirements:
- PostgreSQL 9.3.*
- Sqitch
